    <h2>Dance</h2>
  <p>
    My hobby is <strong>Dance</strong>. I feel <em>joyful</em> and <u>energized</u> whenever I <b>perform</b>. 
    It is not just an art but also a great <mark>exercise</mark> for the body. Dance improves posture and 
    builds <i>confidence</i>. I have been learning classical dance since I was in <sup>6<sup>th</sup></sup> grade. 
    I also love <big>contemporary</big> and <small>hip-hop</small> styles. Dance helps me express emotions and 
    creativity. My favorite form is Bharatanatyam<sub>(South Indian classical)</sub>, and I have performed 
    in many school events. Recently, I <ins>won</ins> a prize in a competition where I had earlier <del>lost</del>. 
    It gave me a new boost. Dance, in short, is not just my hobby, it's my <abbr title="Passion And Energy">P&E</abbr>.

   <h2>Listening to music</h2>
   <p>
    My favorite hobby is <strong>listening to music</strong>. It makes me feel <em>relaxed</em> and helps me 
    <u>focus better</u>. I love exploring different <b>genres</b> like pop, classical, and <i>lo-fi</i>. Music can 
    <mark>instantly uplift</mark> my mood when I'm feeling low. I often listen to songs while studying, especially 
    during <sup>late</sup> night sessions. I prefer <big>instrumental</big> music while working and <small>soft beats</small> 
    while resting. Music has the power to heal and energize. I recently <ins>started making playlists</ins> for different 
    moods, which I used to <del>ignore</del> earlier. One of my favorite artists is <abbr title="Taylor Alison Swift">T.S.</abbr>, 
    and her songs always inspire me. I also enjoy lyrics that have deep meanings written in <sub>simple words</sub>.
